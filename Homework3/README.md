Task: Basically, we’re building the ghost detector (aka an EMF - electromagneticfield - detector). It’s super easy to build, and you will have to look on the internet how to do it. 

Components:
 * 1 7-segment display
 * 1 passive buzzer
 * 2 330 ohm resistors (for the 7-segment display), 1 100 ohm resistor (for the buzzer) and 3 1M resistors (for the antenna)
 * wires
